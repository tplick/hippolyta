<h4>Compiling</h4>

<P>To compile the Amazons bot, type <b>make</b>.
gcc will probably yield the best results (I also tested with clang and icc
but the resulting executables were slower).
Now execute
<pre>src/hippolyta -t</pre>
to run the automated test suite.  If any of the tests fails, email me.

<P>Assuming all the tests have passed, you can try out the bot by running this command:
<pre>src/hippolyta 0001001000000000000000000000001000000001000000000000000000002000000002000000000000000000000002002000</pre>
It should think for a while and then output three squares (source, destination, target).
Hopefully it has chosen the move d1-d7/g7 or g1-g7/d7.

<P>The Amazons bot takes as an argument one string of 100 characters.  This encodes the state of the board
from square a1 to square j10: empty squares are represented by 0, arrows by 3, and Amazons by 1 or 2.
When the number of arrows is even, it is player 1's turn; when odd, it is player 2's turn.

<P>The output of the program is the names of three squares, one per line.
If the program wants to resign, it will instead print "resign" and then two blank lines.
(There is actually a fourth line of output that comes after the move;
the fourth is used for the messages that say
"I count XX territory for me versus XX for you.")

<P>The program is invoked once for each move that is generated;
the program prints its move and then exits.  This is different from how (for example)
chess engines work, but it is simple and easy to work with.

<P>To see all the bot's options, run

<pre>src/hippolyta -h</pre>

<P>You can set the thinking time in seconds by using the -s option.  This time is only a suggestion, though;
near the beginning of the game, the bot will usually take several minutes to pick its move.


<h4>Connecting to LittleGolem</h4>

<P>This part is complicated and needs to be done carefully!  I suggest using Firefox for this, because
Firefox provides easy access to browser cookies.

<ul>
<li>Visit Little Golem in Firefox, right-click on the page, and select View Page Info.

<li>Under Security, click View Cookies.  There should be several cookies there from littlegolem.net.  Delete them.

<li>Close the dialog window.  Register a new account on Little Golem as normal.

<li>Once you receive your login password, return to the site and log in under the new account.  (If you wish,
you can edit your bot's profile now.)

<li>View the site cookies again, then open LOGIN.py in a text editor.  Replace the dots in the variable Cookie
with the appropriate values from the browser cookie.

<li>In Firefox, delete the cookies from littlegolem.net again.

<li>Go into the top-level directory and run the script <b>main.sh</b>.
</ul>

<i>It is important to delete the cookies before and after creating the bot's account.  If you do not do this,
the bot may try to play your turns instead of its own!</i>

<P>This process is a little annoying, but the good news is that after you do it once,
you should never have to do it again.
My bot's cookie is still working after four years!

<P>The bot should now be running.  To confirm this, challenge it to a game of Amazons.  The bot should accept your
challenge within 5 to 10 minutes.


<h4>A quick overview of the Python script</h4>

<P>This script is called periodically to play turns and answer invitations.
As written, it accepts Amazons invitations and rejects all others.
To modify this behavior, modify the function <b>answerInvitation</b>.

<P>To support a new game, you must modify the function <b>handleGame</b>
to interpret the board for that game.  Then (if you program your bots the same way I did)
pass the game state to your program and listen for the move that the bot generates.
Look at the <b>handleXXXGame</b> functions for examples.  (If you add support for a new game,
remember to allow your bot to answer invitations for that game!)

<h4>Overview of the Amazons bot</h4>

<P><b>bits128.c:</b> Operations on 128-bit integers.  The engine represents the board as a set of 128-bit
bitfield.  Bit 0 corresponds to a1, bit 1 corresponds to a2, etc., but bit 11 corresponds to b1.
The engine pretends that there is an eleventh column and an eleventh row, and these are filled with
arrows when the position is created.
This is done to speed up the logic in several places throughout the program.
For instance, to determine whether two squares are adjacent,
we figure out whether the absolute value of their difference is 1, 10, 11, or 12.
(This system is somewhat reminiscent of the 0x88 board representation used in
older chess programs.)
This board representation requires 121 bits, which conveniently fits into our 128-bit bitfields.

<P>Our 128-bit ``integers'' are actually composed of two 64-bit integers.
The logical bit operations are defined in a straightforward way.  The shiftUp/shiftDown
operation is crucial to the evaluator, as it is used to assign the squares on the board
to each player's territory.  If you are running on a 32-bit system, gcc will synthesize
the 64-bit operations in terms of 32-bit integers, so the program will still work for you
(albeit with a speed penalty).  In fact, I am still running on 32-bit, so the program will
probably run a lot faster for you than it does for me!


<P><b>hamilton.c:</b> Hamiltonian move search.  When the main search procedure decides to move
in a territory that is sealed off and contains only one Amazon, this code will be called
to try to find a safe path.  The code searches for a path of adjacent squares,
starting with the Amazon's current square, that fills the entire territory.
(Such a path is called a Hamiltonian path in graph theory.)
If such a path is found, the engine moves its Amazon to the next square in the path
and fires an arrow onto the Amazon's original square; in this way, we are sure that the
entire territory can be filled.  If no such path is found in the alloted search time
(one-sixth of the main search time) then the original move is used instead.

<P><b>tests.c:</b> These are automated tests that you can run by passing -t to the amazons program.
It is recommended that you run these before trying to use the bot.  The tests should catch compiler
problems (no 64-bit type, insufficient stack space) or any bugs that you might introduce when modifying
the position generation logic.


<P>
<P>Have fun!  Ask me for help if you get stuck.


<h4>Acknowledgements</h4>

I am indebted to Richard Lorentz and to pedropajarito on Little Golem for their help in testing
Hippolyta's playing performance.  Richard has facilitated several practice games between Hippolyta and
his world-champion Amazons program Invader.  pedropajarito has played dozens of practice games against
Hippolyta, improving her performance in the process.  I must note that since he's been playing against
Hippolyta, his own rating has climbed as well :)
